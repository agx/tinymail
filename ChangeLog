2007-10-10  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* m4/moz.m4: add support for gtkmozembed library using gtkembedmoz.pc.
	Also export mozilla_home.
	* debian/rules.maemo: compile with mozembed support.
	* debian/control.maemo1: compile with mozembed support.
	* tests/c-demo/tny-main.c: remove mozilla calls in main.
	* configure.ac: some fixes for html module detection. Use mozilla home.
	Now we only use detection of xpcom for being sure we've got an engine
	path.
	* Removed libtinymailui-mozembed/mozilla-preferences.{cpp,h}, as we now
	use gtk moz embed api to set preferences.
	* libtinymalui-mozembed/Makefile.am: removed mozilla preferences from
	build.
	* libtinymailui-mozembed/tny-moz-embed-html-mime-part-view.c:
	Now we use gtk moz embed to set preferences. We also set properly the
	component path (mozilla home from used engine), and the profile path
	(using the progname). We set a default chrome without scrollbars.

2007-10-08  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Merged camel-mime-utils.c with uptream Camel

2007-10-07  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Backported a patch from Niels Christens on Camel to Camel-Lite. The
	patch fixed the behaviour when the server expects a TLS HELLO, while
	SSL version 2 is used.
	* Merged camel-lite with upstream Camel revision 8099
	* Merged bugfix from Matthew Barnes. More information here:
	http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=437331
	* Changed the address of FSF in the copyright notes
	* Further merging upstream Camel with camel-lite

2007-10-04  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	- -Wall warnings
	- -pedantic warnings
	- TnyCamelSendQueue should not error if the TnyDevice went offline
	- Bugfixes in TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel

2007-10-03  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.c:
	(tny_merge_folder_get_id): fixed id generation. We
	were setting this with a fixed value always due to
	an error in initialisation. Now we calculate an
	id with the merged folder id's and their account
	id's.
	(tny_merge_folder_get_url_string): created 
	implementation. Now it gets the merge folder id
	as part of the url string with this format:
	"merge://ID"

2007-09-28  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Unsigned integers can't be < 0

2007-09-26  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-common.c,
	(_foreach_email_add_to_inet_addr): now we don't use
	strtok_r() to split the string to addresses, as we
	weren't taking into account the quotes. I implemented
	a new _split_recipients() method that takes quotes
	into account.
	(_string_to_camel_inet_addr): now we remove the quotes
	in the name part of an address, as they are added by
	camel part automatically.

2007-09-26  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed (avoided) a memory leak in saving CamelObject's states
	* Sending messages, some fixes for the CC and BCC fields
	* Date-Received on maildir was foobar

2007-09-25  Mark Doffman <mark.doffman@codethink.co.uk>

	from the automatically generated bindings. 

	* /bindings/python/README: Update for changes to the way
	the python bindings are generated.
	
	* /tests/python-demo/*: Add implementations of a tny-list
	iterator, platform factory, and account store. Update the 
	svn ignore to ignore the compiled python files. 

	* /tests/python-demo/tinymail-python-test.py: Modify to use
	the python implementation of the platform factory.
	
2007-09-24  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	to the tinymail library.

	* bindings/python/Makefile.am: Added a generated file to 
	the CLEANFILES to fix release problems.

2007-09-18  Sergio Villar Senín  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: fixed an issue when
	transferring folders, the CamelFolderInfo of the parent of the folder
	that is moved is now NULLized.

2007-09-18  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed a possible crash when renaming folders

2007-09-17  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/local/camel-maildir-folder.c:
	Add implementation of method rewrite_cache for maildir,
	so that we can implement also purge in maildir.

2007-09-17  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Added callback, status_callback and user_data to
	tny_gtk_header_list_model_set_folder
	* Added a canceled parameter to the TnyCamelSetOnlineCallback

	* This was a major API change

2007-09-17  Mark Doffman  <mark.doffman@codethink.co.uk>

	* /bindings/python/gendefs/defsgen.py:
	Modify so that only non-virtual methods can be 
	generated.

	* /bindings/python/gendefs/Makefile.am:
	Generate virtual method definitions for Tinymail
	and Tinymailui libraries.

	* /bindings/python/*.defs: Include virtual method
	definitions. All Tinymail and Tinymailui interfaces
	are implementable. 

	* /bindings/python/*.override: I add type definitions
	to fix bindings compilation problems when used with    
	updated .defs files.

2007-09-14  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* TnyCamelSendQueue's sent-msg signal emission (some corrections)
	* Small locking problem when requesting the unread-count of a
	TnyCamelFolder
	* Disconnecting the old settings if new settings are set and
	tny_camel_account_set_online is issued (experimental)
	* Crash fixes when alerting 

2007-09-13  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-folder.c: Remove assertion that expects folder 
	names to have 1 character at least (at least in my IMAP server 
	we've got empty strings as valid imap folders).

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg-header-priv.h: Add internal API
	to set a decorated header (at least for updating flag values).
	
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg-header.c: Now we can set an 
	internal decorated TnyHeader instance. For flags operations, 
	we'll set/unset/get also the decorated header.
	
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-partial-msg-receive-strategy.c: Now
	we set the folder header as decorated by the msg header. This way 
	the flags are set correctly in folder when we set a flag from the 
	header obtained from the message.
	
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-full-msg-receive-strategy.c: Now we 
	set the folder header as decorated by the msg header.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c: fixed a problem in the
	notification of a folder removal that could cause a SIGSEV when
	deleting a tree of folders with messages.

2007-09-05  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed folder renames for local folders
	* Fixed a bug about keeping folders open

2007-09-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.h: Change the 
	TnyCamelGetSupportedSecureAuthCallback callback to provide a
	GError* instead of a GError**, because it is not an output parameter.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c: (on_supauth_idle_func),
	(tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication_async_thread
	), (tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication):
	Adapt to the change, propagating GErrors up to the callback.

2007-09-04  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed a problem when folder creation failed: observers where
	nevertheless notified about a folder creation in this case

2007-09-04  Mark Doffman  <mark.doffman@codethink.co.uk>

	* bindigs/python/*: restructuring the Python language bindings

2007-09-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	(tny_camel_account_set_url_string_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_name_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_id_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_secure_auth_mech_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_proto_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_user_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_hostname_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_port_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_pass_func_default),
	(tny_camel_account_set_forget_pass_func_default): Check that the input 
	is differnt to the existing value, to avoid unnecessarily signalling that 
	the account has changed.

2007-09-04  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Fixed bug in update folder observers call, creating 
	the new change object to propagate it to observers.
 
2007-09-04  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: fixed the default function
	used to implement the get_local_size interface

2007-09-04  Vivek Sekar  <viveksekar@gmail.com>

	* Added AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(.) to
	libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/configure.ac : fixes a maemo integration
	build error.
	
2007-09-04  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed a possible race condition in CamelMultiPart
	* Fixed thread stack leakage on threads that are joinable but never
	joined
	* Major changes in TnyFolderStoreQuery and TnyFolderStoreQueryItem.
	Support for non-regular expression matches and case insensitive
	matching added.

	* This was a major API change

2007-09-03  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed a filedescriptor leak when there are no items in a folder, on
	summary.mmap
	* Changed the Copyright of tny-vfs-stream.c: the original is not
	really recognizable anymore so it shouldn't copy the copyright of the
	original as this is not a copy anymore.
	* Date, Received, INTERNALDATE: fixes 
	* Fixed filedescriptor leaks with local folders
	* Fixed online command attempts when password got cancelled
	* Fixed a deadlock when sending failed
	* Fixed some things in TnyCamelSendQueue

	* This was a major API change

2007-09-03  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Add a new API function, tny_send_queue_add_async to define
	user and status callbacks for messages transfer to outbox 
	folder. 

2007-09-03  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.[ch]: added two new functions
	tny_merge_folder_remove_folder
	tny_merge_folder_get_folders

	This is a major API change

2007-08-29  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c
	(tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication_async_thread):
	Call the prepare_func vfunc before asking camel to ask the server for
	auth types so priv->service is set.

2007-08-31 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>
	
	* Fix tny_camel_msg_header_date_(sent|received):
		- don't try to normalize to GMT (camel already does that)
		- only use Date: for received if not received date is found
	* don't try to disconnect from conic if the IAP == NULL, as that
	  causes a segfault

2007-08-29 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Set the correct X-Priority: header values, and parse the correct
	  as well (1 (Highest), 2 (High), 3 (Normal), 4 (Low), 5 (Lowest))

2007-08-28  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Added a new API function in TnyFolder class: tny_folder_remove_msgs. 
  	This function allows to remove several messages in a single camel 
	operation, avoiding to call excesive times to folder observer 
	notification. 

2007-08-15  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Reading dnsmasq's resolv.conf files to know whether or not we are
	initially online or not in libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c

2007-08-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_offline): Fix a compiler warning 
	about an unused variable.

2007-08-15  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Improved the TnyMaemoConicDevice a bit
	* Making TnyMaemoConicDevice wait five seconds before proxing the
	emission of a connection-change as a Tinymail signal. It seems that
	there are various states of "being online" for Conic. You are quite
	early notified of being online: sometimes before the dhcp client
	managed to fill-in resolv.conf, causing hostname lookup failures as
	Tinymail as soon as possible tried to go online. With the five seconds
	delay we are hoping that the device will have setup all right by the
	time Tinymail attempts to go online. Please monitor this behaviour in
	future and review carefully.

2007-08-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init): Change the is_online default 
	to TRUE.
	* This is a hack that fixes a problem
	* (Our signal is not emitted before the gtk mainloop is started, 
	* because we use an idle handler for that and we don't know how to 
	* detect when the mainloop has not yet started.
	* The downside is that we now don't know that we are really offline,
	* so we can't ask the user to go online.
	* This must be fixed properly.

2007-08-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c: (conic_emit_status):
	Do not check for a running mainloop, because we know of no working 
	way to do this, and it causes hangs if we never use the idle handler.
	See the comments in the code.

2007-08-15  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Moved the conic tests to a subdirectory

2007-08-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(conic_emit_status_idle), (conic_emit_status):
	If no mainloop is running (for instance, before gtk_main_run()), 
	just emit without using g_idle_add(). Hopefully this will cause the signal 
	to be emitted early enough - when tinymail needs is_online() to be correct. 
	See the comments to see why this is OK for tinymail.

2007-08-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap):
	Fixed a compiler warnings and a build fix when building for the device. 

2007-08-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init): Initialize is_online before 
	forcing the on_connection_event() signal handler to be called, not after,
	which could explain why is_online sometimes seems to be false at the start 
	when it should not be.

2007-08-14  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_transfer_msgs_default): Remove unused err variable 
	to fix a compiler warning.
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c: Formatting/syntax 
	changes requested by Philip.

2007-08-14  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Recursively removing local directories
	* Smaller bugfixes and performance improvements
	* Enhanced error reporting in the async operations
	* Dealing with certain states (where priv->folder is uninitialized) in
	the async operations
	* Moving observer notifies away from transfer-msgs
	* Moved the io_lock a bit tighter for CamelStoreSummary

	* tests/c-demo/tny-demoui-summary-view.c:
	(on_header_view_tree_row_activated):
	Avoid compiler warnings, such as unused variables, functions without 
	returns, and unused functions. Tinymail now builds with -Wall -Werror 
	again.

2007-08-13  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Improvements in notifying the observers when removing folders
	* Improvements when deleting items
	* When deleting items from a POP, notifying observers
	* Detecting remotely removed objects on POP
	* Not using the too high level subscribe API (which causes unrequired
	signal emissions)
	* Fixed a few memory problems in TnyCamelStoreAccount

2007-08-10  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Enhancements in the POP code, when removing and expunging items

2007-08-09  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

2007-08-08  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Code cleanups in TnyCamelSendQueue
	* Introduction of tny_folder_add_msg_async
	* Better handling of offline (because service is unavailable) cases
	* Making TnySessionCamel's maildir folders behave a bit better
	* Using tny_folder_add_msg_async in tny_camel_send_queue_add_default

	* This was a major API change

2007-08-07  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Consistency in the async callback APIs
	* Cleaning up in case of cancels
	* Making sync_async cancellable
	* Error reporting fixes

	* This was a major API change

2007-08-06  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* GDK lock awareness
	* More conservatism about reconnecting
	* Fixed a few locking problems with POP
	* Callbacks and destroynotifies of cancelled-removed items
	* Fetching of folders happens in a queue item now

2007-08-02  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Reintroduction of cancellation support (this is experimental)
	* Timezone fix in the summary (remove your caches)
	* Making tny_account_cancel actually work, or at least a little bit
	better than before this commit (cleaning up the queue a bit)

2007-08-01  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Reconnect hang fix
	* Invalid cancelled warning fix
	* Tryout fix (I know this doesn't sound very promising) for password questions
	on the mainloop (POP can cause this, in case of an auth error during
	sync operation's reconnect)
	* Added the changed signal to TnyAccount
	* Making tny_account_set_name get propagated to the TnyGtkFolderStore- 
	TreeModel instance.
	* Fixed a kludge in the TnySessionCamel for POP accounts with wrong
	passwords

	* This was a major API change

	* Various fixes that make Modest actually work with this

2007-07-30  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Fixed some bugs in TnyMergeFolder notification function. This
        method was overwriting data into old change, rather than use the 
	new_change structure to propagate changes to observed folders.

        * Fixed bug in TnyCamelSendQueue related with msg-sent signal
	emision. Now, when an error has detected, msg-sent is not emited.

	* camel/camel-mime-parser.c: (folder_scan_content),
	(folder_scan_step): Initialize some variables because 
	valgrind complains about uninitialized variables here. This does not 
	fix it but it should make things clearer for someone who can fix it.

2007-07-27  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Merged tny-camel-folder.c with devel/sessionwork's version
	* This moves the poke-status operations to the account's queue
	* Merged camel-pop3-engine.c with devel/sessionwork's version
	* This fixes a locking problem while disconnecting the POP account

	* Merging the Cond patch from devel/sessionwork

2007-07-29  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* The long awaited alert, get_pass and forget_pass now in the mainloop

	* This was a major API and behaviour change

2007-07-29  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed a race condition when the account was or is connection or not
	yet finished connecting while the connection-status-changed signal was
	already being used. Introduced a new API for this
	* Introduced the tny_account_is_ready API, which indicates when an
	account is not only valid as instance, but also fully registered
	within the system.
	* Implemented some missing implementations in TnyCombinedAccount

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-27  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Dealing with remotely removed folders
	* The poke status calls are now on the same queue as the other
	operations
	* Rewritten the TnySessionCamel infrastructure that connects accounts
	and sets them up
	* Added support for detecting folder changes to
	TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel
	* API change on tny_camel_account_set_online. The last argument is now
	a callback rather than a GError. In the callback you can know about
	when the account got connected and if not, why it failed

	* Cond locks in the queues of the store accounts while the callbacks
	are happening. This is a significant policy change in locking
	behaviour that should be well tested. 

	* This was a major API change in TnyAccount

2007-07-27  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Branchpoint "devel/sessionwork"

2007-07-26  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* More granularity in the locking of the POP code
	* Several fixes in the POP code
	* Folder renaming for local folders

2007-07-25  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Various locking improvements in the POP code
	* Parallel retrieval of messages
	* Disconnecting after summary retrieval of a POP folder
	* Disconnecting after get-msg and sync of a POP folder
	* Some reference counting problems when factoring folders

2007-07-24  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Preparing for a release candidate
	* Added skeleton for webkit support
	* Restructuring the internal API for async methods a bit
	* Experimental lining up of async functions in one thread

2007-07-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c: Improved the 
	documentation for tny_camel_account_set_online().

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.c: (tny_merge_folder_get_id),
	(tny_merge_folder_instance_init): Use 
	unknown_mergefolder instead of an empty string for the default ID, 
	because an empty string is not allowed by the get_func_id() DBC 
	contract, causing a crash at runtime when DBC is enabled in the build.

2007-07-23  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.c:
	(camel_imap_recon): if there's no reconnection operation, then we don't
	call it, preventing crashes.

2007-07-23  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>
	
	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-folder.c:
	(imap_refresh_info): now we lock the folder also, before locking the
	service, in order to respect better the lock order. This should avoid
 	some locks.
	
	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-store.[ch]:
	now we store a reference to the struct addrinfo used for connections. When
	we are successful getting a valid addrinfo, it's stored and reused. This
	way we prevent doing lots of calls to getaddrinfo and subsequent name
	resolutions. As we're currently blocking while name resolution is running,
	this should make the application more reponsive in general and avoid
	flooding the connection.
	We also removed the method (camel_imap_service_connect) as it's not used.
	
	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-private.h:
 	added parenthesis to some lock macros.
 
2007-07-23  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: protect a folder lock
	with a reason. This prevents some interlock problems, as the
	last unreason can lead to a folder lock.
	
2007-07-23  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-camel-mime-part.c:
	(tny_camel_mime_part_get_parts_default): improve detection
	of attached messages, as we need to create a proper TnyMsg
	object when the attachment is a message.
	(tny_camel_mime_part_add_part_default): now when we are
	attaching a message as a part, it's created adding a 
	message/rfc822 mime part that contains the message as
	its content object. This fixes attaching messages.

2007-07-13  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Allowing the POP code to do RETRs while the TOPs are working (while
	summary is being retrieved, allow the POP code to receive messages
	already)
	* Avoiding a join in the mainloop
	* Reconnecting and connection failing for POP, in case of connection
	problems

2007-07-12  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* Added a new parameter to the constructor of a merge folder which is
	the name of the new merge folder

	* This is a major API change

2007-07-12  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed the POP unread count problems

2007-07-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	(tny_camel_account_matches_url_string_default): For maildir accounts, 
	compare their paths before the # marker for the folder, to avoid 
	considering all maildir accounts to be the same account.

2007-07-11  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c: Recreate folder list
	after a new folder has been created so that subsequent calls to
	_get_folder() contain the newly created folder.

2007-07-11 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>
	* Don't set subject to 'No Subject' if it's empty
	(camel-mime-message.c)

2007-07-09  Javier Fernández García-Boente <jfernandez@igalia.com>
	* Implements and emits msg-sending and msg-sent signals
	when a message is just being sent and when is fully sent. 
        * Add a notification about EXPUNGED header change in 
	tny_camel_folder_remove_msg_default method.

2007-07-10  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Made the connecting of accounts more finegrained (once more)
	* Introduced the required tny_session_camel_set_initialized API
	* Preserving flags on POP

	* This was a major change in behaviour when connecting and at
	initialization
	* This was a major API change

2007-07-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-account-store.h: alert_func vfunc:
	* libtinymail/tny-account-store.c: (tny_account_store_alert):
	* libtinymail-acap/tny-acap-account-store.c:
	(tny_acap_account_store_alert):

	(tny_olpc_account_store_alert):
	* tests/shared/account-store.c: (tny_test_account_store_alert):
	Add a TnyAcccount* parameter to the alert_func vfunc, so that 
	applications an show information about the account (and server) 
	that failed. This is documented as sometimes being NULL for current 
	implementations (see the *ssl.c comment below).

	* camel/camel-session.h:
	* camel/camel-session.c: (camel_session_alert_user),
	(camel_session_alert_user_with_id),
	(camel_session_alert_user_generic): Added a CamelService* 
	paramteter to these functions. For tinymail, this allows us to use 
	CamelService::data to get the TnyAccount*. 
	* camel/camel-disco-diary.c: (camel_disco_diary_log),
	(diary_decode_folder):
	* camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-command.c:

	* camel/providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c: (smtp_connect):
	Pass the CamelService::data to camel_session_alert_user*().
	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-openssl.c: (ssl_verify):
	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-ssl.c: (ssl_bad_cert): Pass NULL for 
	service_user_data because I cannot see a suitable CamelService. 
	See the TODOs.

2007-07-10  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Added the tny_folder_get_local_size API
	* Fixed the folder deletion of maildir folders
	* Added the get_local_size implementation to TnyMergeFolder
	* Implementing missing implementation of sync_async in TnyMergeFolder

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-enums.h:
	* libtinymail/tny-error.h: 
	* libtinymail/tny-error.c: (tny_error_get_type):
	Added TNY_TRANSPORT_ACCOUNT_ERROR_SEND_USER_CANCEL 
	and TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_USER_CANCEL.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	(_tny_camel_account_get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id):
	Handle CAMEL_EXCEPTION_USER_CANCEL as 
	TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_USER_CANCEL, so that applications 
	can ignore this.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-transport-account.c:
	(get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id):
	Likewise, handle as CAMEL_EXCEPTION_USER_CANCE as 
	TNY_TRANSPORT_ACCOUNT_ERROR_SEND_USER_CANCEL.

2007-07-09  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Added the tny_folder_sync_async method. Boutifully paradoxical by
	name!

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-09  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Changed the cache-dir locations to ones that are more suitable for
	mor types of filesystems
	* Added the user to IMAP cache-dir locations

2007-07-09  Javier Fernández García-Boente <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Change way to manage priority flags (2 bits) 
        on maildir folders. Now, HIGH_PRIORITY flag
	will be used as bit mask to extract priority flags
	and compare them with specific bits flag.

2007-07-09  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* tny-camel-mime-part.c:
	(tny_camel_mime_part_get_parts): now, if the mime part is a
	multipart/related, it sets the content disposition of the children
	to inline for parts that didn't get a disposition before. This
	should improve handling of inline attached images.

2007-07-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-enums.h:
	* libtinymail/tny-error.c: (tny_error_get_type):
	* libtinymail/tny-error.h:
	Added TNY_TRANSPORT_ACCOUNT_ERROR_SEND_HOST_LOOKUP_FAILED, 
	TNY_TRANSPORT_ACCOUNT_ERROR_SEND_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, 
	TNY_TRANSPORT_ACCOUNT_ERROR_SEND_AUTHENTICATION_NOT_SUPPORTED
	GError enum values.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-transport-account.c:
	Added get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id(),
	(tny_camel_transport_account_send_default): Provide a 
	more specific GError code to the caller, so that this will 
	be provided with the TnySendQueue "error-happened" signal.
	(tny_camel_transport_account_try_connect): 
	Use _tny_camel_account_get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id() 
	here to provide a more specific error code.

2007-07-09  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Improvement for tny_camel_mime_part_is_attachment_default
	* Deleting non-empty folders of a maildir
	* Unread and seen counts are (or should be) unrelated
	* The tny_account_set_pass_func must now always be the last to set

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-08  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Yet another attempt at fixing the namespace problem (empty root
	folders)
	* Fixed a disconnect at startup (temporary fix)
	* Fixed a problem when creating folders (found by Armin Burgmeier)

2007-07-08  Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Temporary empty root folder fix

2007-07-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-enums.h:
	* libtinymail/tny-error.h:
	* libtinymail/tny-error.c: (tny_error_get_type):
	Added TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_CERTIFICATE and documented the enum 
	values that I added last time.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	(_tny_camel_account_get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id):
	Handle CAMEL_EXCEPTION_SERVICE_CERTIFICATE as TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_CERTIFICATE.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-session-camel.c:
	(tny_session_camel_alert_user): Adapt signature, as follows.
	Also handle the CAMEL_EXCEPTION_USER_CANCEL error ID instead of checking the message text. 

	* camel/camel-exception-list.def: Added CAMEL_EXCEPTION_SERVICE_CERTIFICATE.
	* camel/camel-session.h:
	* camel/camel-session.c: (camel_session_alert_user): Take a CamelException 
	instead of a message, so we don't lose the error ID sometimes.
	(camel_session_alert_user_with_id),
	(camel_session_alert_user_generic): Convenience functions to use when 
	no CamelException is available.

	* camel/providers/smtp/camel-smtp-transport.c: (smtp_connect):
	Use the exception instead of just the message with camel_session_alert_user(), 
	so that the application has the error code. 

	* camel/camel-disco-diary.c: (camel_disco_diary_log),
	(diary_decode_folder):
	* camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-command.c:
	(camel_imap_command_response), (camel_imap_command_response_idle):
	* camel/providers/imap4/camel-imap4-engine.c:
	(camel_imap4_engine_parse_resp_code):
	* camel/providers/imap4/camel-imap4-summary.c:
	(courier_imap_is_a_piece_of_shit): Use camel_session_alert_user_generic() 
	instead of camel_session_alert_user(), because we have no ID or exception here.

	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-openssl.c: (ssl_verify):
	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-ssl.c: (ssl_bad_cert): Use the new 
	CAMEL_EXCEPTION_SERVICE_CERTIFICATE error ID here. There are still many different 
	types of certificate error, but this at least classifies them a bit.

2007-07-05  Armin Burgmeier  <armin@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.c: When propagating a TnyFolderChange
	notified from one of the underlaying folders, do copy that
	TnyFolderChange and set the changed folder of that copy to the merge
	folder. Also, do not propagate folder renames because the merge folder
	itself has not been renamed.

2007-07-07  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed a crasher when transferring messages

2007-07-06  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg-header.c:
	(tny_camel_msg_header_set_flags, tny_camel_msg_header_get_flags,
	tny_camel_msg_header_unset_flags): added support to store and
	retrieve the TNY_HEADER_FLAG_ATTACHMENTS.

2007-07-06  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-enums.h:
	* libtinymail/tny-error.h: Added 
	TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_HOST_LOOKUP_FAILED, 
	TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE and 
	TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT_AUTHENTICATION_NOT_SUPPORTED so 
	that the TnyAccountStore::alert_func() callback can sometimes get 
	more specific information, so that it doesn't need to just blindly show 
	the camel internal error message.
	* libtinymail/tny-error.c: Updated tny_error_get_type(), though this should be 
	generated code as in GTK+.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account-priv.h:
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	Added _tny_camel_account_get_tny_error_code_for_camel_exception_id() for 
	choosing a suitable tinymail GError code.
	(_tny_camel_account_try_connect), (_tny_camel_account_set_online):
	Use a specific error code for the GErrors.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-session-camel.c:
	(tny_session_camel_alert_user): Add a TODO noting that this is where we 
	lose some specific error codes, and where we do a dodgy string comparison 
	on the message text.

	* camel/camel-exception-list.def: Added a 
	CAMEL_EXCEPTION_SYSTEM_HOST_LOOKUP_FAILED error code enum value.
	* camel/camel-net-utils.c: (camel_getaddrinfo):
	Use the new error code when appropriate.

2007-07-06  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Added some non standard flags to the maildir support
	* Support for suspended items in sendqueues
	* Fixed an API glitch in TnyFolderChange
	* Empty folder bugfix
	* Added a guard to tny_mime_part_set_filename for NULL situations

2007-07-05  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixes for the new headers after a transfer of messages happened
	* Fixed for new headers after adding a message happened

2007-07-05  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	The asynchronous operations now always call the callbacks in an idle
	if the GMainLoop is available, even if the thread could not be
	started.
	Refactored the code that invokes the user callbacks.
	Changed the priority of the idles, now the status callbacks have
	higher priority than the function callbacks.
	
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c:
	The asynchronous operations now always call the callbacks in an idle
	if the GMainLoop is available, even if the thread could not be
	started.

2007-07-05  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Renamed removed to expunged in TnyFolderChange

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-04  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Dealing with the first connection status of the device instance
	* Several race conditions when rapidly connecting and disconnecting

2007-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_dummy_connection_check): Changed the check for a NULL iap
	(though it should have worked already) to ensure that the signal 
	is always emitted at initialization.
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_online): Do not just return if we 
	are in scratchbox. Nothing here is libconic-specific. This 
	makes is_online() return the correct value after calling force_online().

2007-07-04  Johannes Schmid <johannes.schmid@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.c:
	Added API doc

2007-07-04  Johannes Schmid <johannes.schmid@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.[ch]:
	Added tny_merge_folder_set_folder_type() API to be able
	to assign a different folder type to a tny-merger-folder

	* This was a major API change

2007-07-04  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Implementation of tny_folder_poke_status for the total count of a
	POP folder

2007-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_dummy_connection_check): Move this to before the first use.
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_is_online): Put use of on_dummy_connection_check() 
	in an ifdef to avoid a linker failure.

2007-07-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_dummy_connection_check): Set is_online here instead of waiting for it to be 
	set in the signal, becacuse this is used to do a quick check without waiting for the timout 
	to check the file.
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_is_online): In the dummy scratchbox implementation, call 
	on_dummy_connection_check() before returning is_online, so that it is accurate.

	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_finalize): Don't use libconic at all if we are in scratchbox, 
	because it signals that there is no connection, which confuses our dummy implementation.

2007-07-04  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Total count of POP3 folders
	* Thread joining between the TnyCamelSendQueue and the TnySessionCamel
	connection threads
	* Error handling in TnyMergeFolder

2007-07-03  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Bugfix in TnyCamelTransportAccount's prepare method
	* Fixing up the TnyCamelSendQueue's at-connect
	* Bugfix in renaming on IMAP
	* Improved the granularity of the is_connected flag
	* Bugfixed a crasher at perform_content_info_save in
	CamelFolderSummary
	* Fixed a bug in case From addresses become excessively long
	* Bugfix when transferring messages (folder observers getting the
	right TnyHeader instances)
	* Fixed a lock when setting headers while fetching summary
	* Bugfix when tny_camel_account_set_online was called from the
	mainloop

2007-07-02  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed a bug in Maildir when setting flags
	* Fixed empty-string folders at root's level on IMAP
	* Fixed blocking reads and writes in camel-tcp-stream-openssl.c,
	camel-tcp-stream-raw.c (camel-file-utils.c) and camel-tcp-stream-nss.c
	* Fixed a IDLE-stop problem when renaming a folder

2007-07-02  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_connect): When using scratchbox, show an 
	OK/Cancel dialog and write a fake connection name to the text file, 
	to simulate what libconic does on the device.
	(on_dummy_connection_check): Interpret 'none' in the text file as 
	meaning no connection. This leaves an empty file as defaulting to 
	a meaning of connection debugid0. (tny_maemo_conic_device_get_
	current_iap_id): Return NULL if the iap is 'none', when in scratchbox.

2007-07-02  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fallback for BINARY
	* Fallback for UIDPLUS
	* Added a check for the session in TnyCamelTransportAccount
	* Bugfix when finalizing an account
	* Removed some old internal hooks-API

2007-07-01  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed/updated the Python bindings
	* Fixed the gtk-doc API documentation genation process
	* Updated the online gtk-doc API documentation
	* Prepared a testing QEmu virtual machine
	* Marked the Kolumbus IMAP server as an idiot's IMAP server, as it
	doesn't correctly support UIDPLUS and BINARY

2007-06-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_connect):
	Removed debug output.

2007-06-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_connect): Use GDK_THREADS_ENTER/LEAVE as 
	used by gdk_dialog_run(), because a second g_main_loop_run() seems 
	to hang when gdk_threads_init() has been called before (by the app, 
	for instance). I don't like having these at this level, so we 
	should try to fix it properly later.

2007-06-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c: 
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_connect):
	Use a second mainloop instead of iterating the main mainloop. This 
	seems more robust and is probably the recommended way to do it.
	There is lots of debug output here, which I will remove later after 
	further investigations.

2007-06-29  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Bugfix in TnyCamelTransportAccount: rewrote the prepare method

2007-06-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_disconnect): Fix a warning about an 
	uninitialized variable. Nobody is using this function yet anyway.

2007-06-29  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Various connectivity bugfixes
	* Fixed a locking problem when connectivity changes
	* Bugfix in poke-status
	* Crasher fixed (NULL function pointer)

2007-06-28  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Slowing down the STATUS commands
	* Detecting connection changes with the connection_status_changed
	signal on TnyAccount
	* Multiple fixes when reconnecting
	* Initial folder-list when starting the application offline

	* This was a major API change

2007-06-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-mess
	age-cache.c: (camel_imap_message_cache_replace_with_wrapper):
	Comment out unused variables to prevent warnings.
	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/imap/camel-imap-mess
	age-cache.h: Actually declare 
	camel_imap_message_cache_replace_with_wrapper(), to avoid a warning 
	in came-imap-folder.c.
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_finalize): Add a debug printf here in case 
	this is the cause of disconnections.
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.h:
	Do not include some unnecessary libconic headers. 
	* tests/test-device-conic.c: New test.

2007-06-27  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	These changes add support for purging specific attachments 
	from cache, with an implementation in the IMAP backend. This
	is a major API change.

	* libtinymail/tny-msg.[ch]:
	(tny_msg_rewrite_cache): added new method to rewrite cache
	and expunge purged attachments if supported.

	* libtinymail/tny-mime-part.[ch]:
	(tny_mime_part_is_purged, tny_mime_part_set_purte): added two
	methods that mark a mime part to be purged in cache (in
	storages that support this).

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_rewrite_cache): new method that calls
	the new Camel rewrite cache api for a message.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.[ch]:
	implementation of tny_mime_part_is_purged and
	tny_mime_part_set_purged, to mark parts to be purged
	in IMAP.

	* lintinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/camel-imap-folder.c:
	(imap_rewrite_cache): new method that rewrites the cache representation
	of a message purging attachments marked to be purged.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/providers/camel-imap-message-cache.[ch]:
	(camel_imap_message_cache_replace_with_wrapper): replaces the cache
	entry for a message with a new representation from wrapper. This should
	purge attachments marked as purge, in collaboration with mime part.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-folder.[ch]:
	(rewrite_cache): added default empty implementation and virtual.

	* libtinymail-camel/camel-lite/camel/camel-mime-part.c:
	now, if message disposition is "purged", output for the attachment is
	disabled. This should let user purge attachments on recaching.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg.[ch]:
	(tny_camel_msg_rewrite_cache_default, tny_camel_msg_rewrite_cache): implementation
	of rewrite method using camel new methods to rewrite cache.

2007-06-27  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	Fixed an issue when removing folders. Fixed some issues when moving
	folders, the priv->iter of the camel folders was not correctly created
	so they do not have the right pointers to their children, parents and
	siblings. NOTE that this is a risky patch, not completely tested.

2007-06-27  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Several memory fixes, based on Valgrind error and warning reporting

2007-06-26  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	(tny_simple_list_remove): do not free the item unless it was
	previously found in the list

2007-06-21  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Changes how set_flags function was used on get_full and

	* This was a major API change

2007-06-19  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg-header:
	(tny_camel_msg_header_get_flags): added implementation
	that obtains the priority flags using the headers
	we set in our set/unset methods.
	(tny_camel_msg_header_set_flags, tny_camel_msg_header_set_flags):
	fixed the check for only allowing priority flags to be set or
	unset.
	
	* libtinymail-tests/tny-header-test.c: added unit test for
	priority flags in camel msg header.

2007-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_find_msg_default): Do not require UIDs to be longer than 
	1 character.

2007-06-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/test-conic.c: Added a simple test case to show 
	that libconic does not seem to emit the connection-event signal.

2007-06-19  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed reading the unread and total counts from Maildir folders
	* First baby steps into better connection state detection and handling

	succeed in refreshing the summary correctly
	* Experimental removal of INTERNALDATE from the summary fetch for IMAP

2007-06-18  Javier Fernandez  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

2007-06-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap_list):
	Fix some warnings reported in tinymail trac ticket #66:
	http://tinymail.org/trac/tinymail/ticket/66

2007-06-18  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed the From and the Error reporting when sending messages
	* Fixed the support for Yahoo's SMTP
	* Added some more information to the error-happened signal for
	TnySendQueue

	* This was a major API change

2007-06-17  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Increased read-idle's low timeout times: now that all IDLE happens in
	a thread, it's not necessary anymore to quickly unblock.
	* Code cleanups
	* Connection timeout corrections
	* Read, Read-idle, Read-nonblock timeout corrections
	* Introduction of tny_account_start_operation and
	tny_account_stop_operation

	* This was a major API change

2007-06-15  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Connection failure handling in the IMAP code
	* Experimental timeout for hostname lookups
	* Unread and total count updating
	* Local folders for now will no longer emit "folder_changed" signals
	* The unread and total count of local folders at initial startup
	
2007-06-14  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed some flag values

2007-06-14  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-mime-part.c:
	(tny_camel_mime_part_add_part_default): now, if the
	CamelMimePart has a multipart content type already,
	it's used as the content type of the data wrapper
	if it's created. This way we can create different
	kinds of multiparts in tinymail.
	(tny_camel_mime_part_construct_from_stream_default):
	if the mime part is a message (mime type is
	message/rfc822) then instead of instanciating a
	plain data wrapper, it instanciates a
	CamelMimeMessage. This should prevent problems
	on adding these mime parts to a message or
	mime part.

2007-06-14  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* The cache size of local folders, feature implementation
	* Locking fix for the get-msg service of IMAP

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	(tny_camel_account_matches_url_string_default):
	Actually set the in variable so that the comparison actually happens.
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_find_msg_default): Skip over the / before, not after 
	checking for / at the start. Do a g_warning() if the format is false, 
	to help debugging.

2007-06-13  Antia Puentes Felpeto  <apuentes@igalia.com>
	
	* Added a test in tests/functional that tests removing folders

2007-06-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_get_url_string_default):
	* libtinymail/tny-folder.c:
	* libtinymail/tny-store-account.c: Added documentation and comments 
	about the url-string. Note that Philip fixed 
	tny_folder_get_url_string_default() in a previous commit.

2007-06-13  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Added some extra locking into the camel-lite's POP3 code

2007-06-13  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Added placeholder for future libtinymail-tp
	* This is unfinished material (don't yet use it)

2007-06-12  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Improved the tny_folder_poke_status implementation of TnyCamelFolder
	(performance improvement, made it internally async)
	* Experimental caching of root folder list
	* Added some locking in the CamelPOP3Store and folder

2007-06-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-enums.h: Resynced the fake TnyFolderType enum values 
	from tnyfolder.h and added comments explaining why we have these fake 
	uninstalled enums for gtk-doc, with a link to the gtk-doc bug.
	
	* libtinymail/tny-folder.c:
	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c: (updater),
	(deleter), (find_store_iter): Use TnyFolderType instead of gint when 
	using this column, and initialize it, rather than depending on 
	gtk_tree_model_get() to initialize it. The compiler can't detect these 
	possible unitialized uses.

2007-06-12  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Configurable idle delays
	* Configurable get-message service shutdown timeouts
	* Notifying the observers of a folder when a remove happens
	* Added tny_mime_part_set_header_pair
	* Added the TNY_ACCOUNT_STORE_ERROR_CANCEL_ALERT alert situation

	* This was a major API change
	
2007-06-11  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* The summary camel-lite code no longer puts the uid field in the mmap
	* Several race conditions fixed with the IDLE support
	* The IDLE support is no longer happening in a GMainLoop, but now in a
	thread. This so that the ui of applications on top of Tinymail wont
	hang with very high latency networks like GPRS (experimental)
	* Parallel fetching messages while you are retrieving summary
	(experimental)
	* Race condition fixes when expunged messages didn't get correctly
	removed (for whatever reason in the TnyFolderMonitor): more robust
	* Fixed some IDLE deadlocks
	* Added tny_camel_pop_store_account_reconnect
	* Bugfix for SSL support of camel-lite's SMTP provider

	* This was a minor API change

2007-06-08  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c: Add the tree
	model as an observer of the root folder stores

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-msg-header.c: added support to set
	priority flags through set_flags/unset_flags. The flags are
	properly converted to X-Priority and X-MSMail-Priority headers.

2007-06-07  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel: Fixed a problem when deleting folders that were
	just under an store account.
	* libtibymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c: fixed a problem
	when notifying the observers when a folder was added just under an
	account

2007-06-07  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Merged camel-lite with upstream Camel revision 7777
	* Various connection cancellation problems fixed in the IMAP code
	* Fix for trac ticket #64
	* Fix for sergio, when removing folders the CamelFolderInfo iter was
	still cached
	* tny_folder_poke_status will now, for IMAP, do a STATUS command to
	more accurately find out the UNSEEN and MESSAGES statuses

2007-06-06  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed the OpenSSL support, although I'm leaving the warnings in
	place as the support for OpenSSL has not had as much testing as the
	Mozilla/NSS SSL implementations
	* Added the option --with-ssl=nss,openssl,none to the build to assist
	the SSL library availability detection
	* Changed the use_ssl options to "wrapped", "tls", "when-possible" and
	"never" for both POP3 and IMAP
	* Some connection fixes in the IMAP and POP3 connection procedures
	* Fixed the configure.ac of camel-lite, it had a small OpenSSL vs. NSS
	mixup

	* Bugfix for LOGINDISABLED on IMAP
	* Bugfix when connecting (connection status problem)
	* Added the tny_store_account_delete_cache API

	* This was a major API change

2007-06-03  Johannes Schmid  <johannes.schmid@openismus.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication_async_thread
	Fixed implementation to get the secure authentication support
	methods and simplied them a lot.

2007-06-03  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Support for removing messages from a POP server after retrieval
	* Support for tny_header_get_uid on TnyMsg's header instance
	* Removed the warning in libtinymail/tny-folder.c: please use the
	support for DBC in stead. It's specifically designed for this. Read
	the documentation in building.txt to find out how to enable it.

	* This was a major API change

2007-06-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_copy_shared): Initialize some variables 
	to avoid warnings.
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-account-store.c:
	(tny_maemo_account_store_add_store_account),
	(tny_maemo_account_store_add_transport_account):
	Remove unused priv variables, to avoid warnings.

2007-05-31  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_connect): Block until the result is received by  	the on_connection_event() signal handler. This always seems to indicate 
	failure on Maemo Bora, but maybe it works properly in later versions.
	It is OK for this to block because the Maemo connection dialog is 
	totally modal anyway, and because most applications will not be able 
	to do anything sensible while waiting, because the user is already 
	waiting for an operation that he has initiated.

	* libtinymail/tny-folder.c: (tny_folder_get_all_count): Warn when this 
	is not implemented. Maybe not very necessary, but I seem to have had 
	this in my local checkout and maybe things crash without the check. 
	Can be removed later if you like.

2007-05-29  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed an error message when the account's status is offline and a
	cached version of a message is not available in tny_folder_get_msg and
	tny_folder_get_msg_async
	* Lowered the TCP and SSL timeouts

2007-05-29  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: replaced two wrong
	g_object_ref's by g_object_unref's in the copy_async implementation

2007-05-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_dummy_connection_check): Strip whitespace from the dummy account ID 
	found in the special file.
	
2007-05-28  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_current_iap_id),
	(on_dummy_connection_check),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_finalize): Use a file 
	($HOME/maemo_conic_dummy_id) instead of an environment variable to 
	set the dummy ID when using scratchbox so we can check it for changes 
	every 1 second.
	
2007-05-28  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Experimental reuse of the get-message service for IMAP

2007-05-27  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Various fixes for the OLPC build
	* Various fixes for the Maemo mistal and gregale builds

2007-05-26  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Experimental connection recovery for IMAP
	* Letting IDLE/PushE-mail support code cope with connection failures

2007-05-25  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* libtinymail-camel-tny-camel-send-queue.c: various locking fixes

2007-05-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap): When running in scratchbox, 
	make sure that this returns an instance for a more complete fake 
	implementation.

2007-05-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c:
	(recurse_folders_sync): Do not assume that the row instance is a 
	TnyFolderStore, because not all TnyFolders are TnyFolderStores. 
	This allows us to use this tree model with TnyMergeFolder.

2007-05-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* camel/camel-mime-message.c: (camel_mime_message_set_subject):
	Check that the input char* is not the same as the existing char*, 
	so we do not delete the input before using the input. This happens 
	when get_subject() is given directly to set_subject without a 
	g_strdup(), for instance.

2007-05-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-openssl.c:
	(camel_tcp_stream_ssl_class_init): Add a g_warning() to warn people
	about using this unsupported alternative to NSS.

2007-05-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* camel/camel-tcp-stream-openssl.c: (socket_connect): When calling
	the standard connect () function, use sizeof (struct sockaddr) instead
	of just passing an uninitialized socklen_t, so that this can actually
	succeed, instead of failing with an Invalid Argument errno.

2007-05-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* camel/camel-mime-message.c: (camel_mime_message_set_subject):
	Prevent memory corruption. g_strstrip() does not return a newly
	allocated string. Also, camel_header_encode_string() doesn't seem to
	like being given NULL.

2007-05-22  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Shaped up the Unit tests
	* Fixed a bunch of -Wall warnings
	* Fixed some of the Design By Contract clausules

2007-05-21  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Added a couple of new signals on TnyAccountStore and TnyAccount

2007-05-21 Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Use 'what' string parameter of asyn status callback to knonw 
	what operaiton is being executed, in oder to decide if progress
	data is send back or not.a

	* Add camel operation and progress call to 'folder_rename' operation.
	
2007-05-20  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* TnyAccountStore's alert_func has a 'question' parameter now

	* This was a major API change

2007-05-18  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

   	* folder was 'reason' unnecesary in copy_folder_async.
        * fix bug: g_error_free not neccesary after g_error_propagate

2007-05-17  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Recursively removing folders

2007-05-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap_list): When MAEMO_CONIC_DUMMY 
	hack together a list of fake debug* connection IDs as the result, 
	so we can simulate libconic in scratchbox.
	
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_current_iap_id): When MAEMO_CONIC_DUMMY, 
	return a fake debug* connection ID based on the value of a 
	MAEMO_CONIC_DUMMY_IAP_ID environment variable, so we can fake a 
	connection change (though the signal will not be emitted when the 
	environment variable changes.)
	
2007-05-16  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Removed the unworkable tny_folder_set_name, old code should replace
	this with tny_folder_copy with the del parameter set to TRUE and the
	folder store being the one you get using tny_folder_get_folder_store

	* This was a major API change

2007-05-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c:
	(tny_camel_store_account_prepare): Remove a warning that I shouldn't 
	have added in my last commit.

2007-05-16  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Some clarity for tny_folder_transfer_msgs in a GError for the
	developer who uses TnyHeader instances that came from
	tny_msg_get_header (he has to use the ones that he got from
	tny_folder_get_headers, not any others).

2007-05-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.h:
	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-account.c:
	Added tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication(), 
	to get a list of strings for use with 
	tny_account_set_secure_auth_mech(), by querying the server. This is 
	async, providing the result via a callback.

	* libtinymail/tny-error.h: Added TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_GET_SUPPORTED_AUTH, 
	for use by tny_camel_account_get_supported_secure_authentication
	
	* This was a major API change

2007-05-16  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-queues/Makefile.am: install libtinymail-queues header
	files

2007-05-15  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* The new TnyQueue and TnyQueueTasks types
	* Major rewrites of libtinymail-queues
	* It's not stricly depending on AsyncWorker anymore
	* Introduction of libtinymail-asyncworker

	* This was a major API change in libtinymail-queues
	* This was a major API change in libtinymail-asyncworker

2007-05-15  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* A new implementation for tny_folder_copy in libtinymail-camel
	* A new implementation for tny_folder_copy_async in libtinymail-camel
	* Changed the TnyCopyFolderCallback function description

	* This was a major API change

2007-05-14  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Waiting for the + continuation after IDLE
	* Please watch this fix with different IMAP implementations

2007-05-14  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

2007-05-12  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Improved connection / error handling when trying to connect fails
	* Merged camel-lite with camel-svn7713

	* This was a major API change

2007-05-11  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Implemented Rob's priv->stamp++ idea for removing things from an
	TnyGtkHeaderListModel

2007-05-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-account-store.c: tny_account_store_alert(): 
	Document that the vfunc might receive TNY_ACCOUNT_STORE_ERROR as well 
	as just TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR.
	* libtinymail/tny-error.h: Document the TNY_ACCOUNT_ERROR_TRY_CONNECT

	awkward realities, based on discussion with Philip.

	* This was a major API change (due to documentation enhancements)

	enhancement

2007-05-10  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c: Added a new operation 
	tny_camel_folder_copy_async to copy one folder into other one using
	asynchronous operations.
	* libtinymail/tny-status.h: Added new status code for folder_copy_async
	callbacks.
	* libtinymail/tny-shared.h: Defined new callback function to be used in

	to a private type

	* This was a minor API change

2007-05-09  Jose Dapena Paz  <jdapena@igalia.com>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am:
	Now Maemo target also compiles gnomevfs module.
	* debian/control.maemo:
	Added package for gnomevfs module

2007-05-08  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-queues/libtinymail-queues.pc.in: Fixed the name of the
	library in the -l option
	* Some ChangeLog fixes

2007-05-08  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-merge-folder.c: Add cancelled parameter to 
	transfer_msgs_async function.
	* libtinymail/tny-shared.h: Change TransferMsgsAsync callback 
	API function.
	* libtinymail/tny-shared.h: Add a new status code for 
	transfer_msgs_async function.
	* ibtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c : Implementation of 
	status_callbacks calls in transfer_msgs_async function.

2007-05-08  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* -Wall warnings fixed

2007-05-08  Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* make _finalize in tny-maemo-conic-device also do the dummy
	        disconnect, so we don't crash-on-exit in scratchbox

2007-05-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com

	* libtinymail/tny-account-store.c:
	* libtinymail/tny-account-store.h: Change the alert_func vfunc to 
	provide a GError instead of a human-readable error string.
	(tny_account_store_alert): The documentation for this vfunc invoker 
	seems to refer to the vfunc (as is also normal in GTK+), so document 
	how the GError should be used and point out that the application 
	should translate the message and show an appropriate dialog.
	This does not seem to require the definition of a new GError domain - 
	the existing one seems suitable.

2007-05-08  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Real fix for a gtk_tree_model_row_inserted oddity
	* The problem was that me->cur_len was set to 1 to avoid an assertion
	in gtktreemodelsort.c (in gtk_tree_model_sort_build_level). The real
	fix was to check for list_model->cur_len in various GtkTreeModel
	implementations, rather than the list_model->items->len (only
	registered items are valid for GtkTreeModel, while registering is
	slower than simple appends or prepend, as registered requires the
	registration event to happen in the mainloop)

	* Fixes for a bunch of tickets
	* Fixed the IDLE support for folders with == 0 items

2007-05-07  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Workaround for a gtk_tree_model_row_inserted oddity 

2007-05-07 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Fixed some use-before-initalization bugs in tny-maemo-conic-device
	* Don't try to disconnect in the dummy case there

2007-05-06  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Moved some stuff around
	* Created an internal API for status reporting

2007-05-04  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Changed the TnyGetMsgCallback function signature to have a cancelled 
	property.
	* Implemented support for status-callbacks for tny_folder_get_msg_async
	* Changed the demoui to use the get_msg_async functionality for testing
	recent changes

	* This was a major API change

2007-05-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/Makefile.am:
	* libtinymail/tny-idle-stopper-priv.c:
	* libtinymail/tny-idle-stopper-priv.h: Added a helper API to allow 2 or
	more idle handler callbacks to cooperate, so that one can stop the other
	one, in case they are called in an unexpected sequence, which happens 
	when they have different idle priorities. See the API documentation here
	for more details.

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-folder.c:
	(tny_camel_folder_refresh_async_destroyer),
	(tny_camel_folder_refresh_async_callback), (destroy_progress_idle),
	(progress_func), (tny_camel_folder_refresh_async_status),
	(tny_camel_folder_refresh_async_default): Use shared TnyIdleHandler 
	instances, so that the main idle callback can stop the progress idle 
	callback from calling the status callback after the main callback, 
	which causes freed memory to be used, crashing modest. See the comments
	here fore more details.

	* libtinymail/tny-folder.c: Added some text to the 
	tny_folder_refresh_async() callbacks to make the sequence clearer. 
	I think that language bindings will actually need one or more destroy 
	callbacks eventually.

2007-05-04  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Massive changes to TnyGetMsgQueue (unfinished, experimental)
	* Fix for urgent ticket #43

2007-05-03  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>
	* tests/functional/folder-lister-async.c: Fixed a build error in the
	tests caused by the API changes of yesterday
	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-gtk-folder-store-tree-model.c: Fixed a call to
	_get_folders_async() that was receiving the arguments in a wrong
	order

2007-05-02  Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente  <jfernandez@igalia.com>

	* Change API headers of async functions to pass a status callback
	method to get progress information about task execution. 
	* transfer_msgs_async_fun
	* get_folders_async_func
	* Camel implementation functions have been changed, but NULL 
	was assigned to status_callback, for the moment.

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-30  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Added a TnyCombinedAccount type

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-29  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Documentation updates
	* Made a few symbols start with an underscore, so that they are not
	exported by the linker

2007-04-29  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-account-store.c:
	(tny_maemo_account_store_add_store_account),
	(tny_maemo_account_store_add_transport_account):
	Correct NY_ACCOUNT_STORE typos to TNY_ACCOUNT_STORE, to avoid an 
	undefined symbol build error.

	(tny_olpc_device_reset), (tny_olpc_device_force_online),

	Copy/Paste the implementations from TnyGnomeDevice, so these 
	implementations also match the documented behaviour. I wish that 
	GInterfaces could have default implementations that could be shared.

2007-04-28  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Documentation updates
	* Changes to the TnyAccountStore API
	* Removed the memory peak of yesterday (for the unread and total count)

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-27  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Getting the unread and total counts correct. Latest changes
	introduce a memory peak at application startup. This peak can be
	improved by only reading the unread and total counts from the
	summary.mmap files in camel-lite (right now, the entire folder's info
	is read and parsed, causing the peak to occur)

	* Fixed the TnyGenericSendQueue implementation

2007-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail/tny-device.c: Improve the documentation for 
	tny_device_force_online(), tny_device_force_offline(), and 
	tny_device_reset(), describing why/when you might want to use them, 
	and describing how they affect the behaviour of this object. This 
	helps us to implement the underlying vfuncs.

	* libtinymail-gnome-desktop/tny-gnome-device.c:
	(tny_gnome_device_reset), (tny_gnome_device_force_online),
	(tny_gnome_device_force_offline):
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_reset), (on_connection_event),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_online),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_offline),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init): Improve the implementation, 
	to match the documented behaviour.

2007-04-27  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Creating a new connection for getting uncached messages 
	with the IMAP code.

2007-04-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap): Added some 
	comments and  improved the (temporary) debug output so its more 
	obvious what is happening.

	* libtinymail/tny-device.c: Correct the tny_device_force_offline() and 
	tny_device_force_online() documentation. They were swapped.
	This still needs more documentation describing how these behave.

2007-04-26  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_instance_init),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_new): Do all the initialization in init, 
	because _new functions should just call g_object_new() and not 
	access private API, because they are just C convenience functions.
	(on_connection_event), (tny_maemo_conic_device_connect),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_disconnect),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap_list),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_online),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_force_offline),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_finalize): 
	Copy the iap string instead of just storing the pointer, because 
	we have no guarantees about the lifetime of the string that 
	con_ic_event_get_iap_id() returns. Free it in finalize.
	Added g_return_if*() checks for priv->cnx, without which nothing 
	could work.

2007-04-23  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* tny_folder_change_set_received_msg,
	tny_folder_change_get_received_msg and
	TNY_FOLDER_CHANGE_CHANGED_MSG_RECEIVED added

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-24 Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Make tinymail/maemo buildable with or without libconic

2007-04-23  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Introduction of the TnyStatus infrastructure
	* Changed the TnyStatusCallback function prototype to reflect the
	TnyStatus changes
	* Updated the demo-ui to start using the TnyStatus infrastructure

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-23 Javier Fernandez Garcia-Boente

	* Change priority flags management, using a bit mask to get assigned 
	priority.
	* New enumeration to define available priority flags. 

2007-04-21  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Created a TnyGenericSendQueue which implements TnySendQueue in a
	generic way (doesn't strictly depend on the libtinymail-camel impl
	libraries like the TnyCamelSendQueue type)
	* Added the status_callback to tny_folder_get_msg_async
	* Renamed the TnyFolderRefreshStatusCallback to TnyStatusCallback

	* This was a minor API change (new type added)
	* This was a major API change for tny_folder_get_msg_async and
	tny_folder_refresh_async (TnyStatusCallback added and renamed)

2007-04-21  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Made TnyGetMsgQueue not care about the folder (it'll use the
	tny_header_get_folder API)

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-20  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Further implementing of TnyMergeFolder
	* Bugfixes in camel-lite (concurrent camel_folder_get_message on
	folders that are not selected)
	* Introduction of libtinymail-queues (which depens on asyncworker)

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-18  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Further implementing of TnyMergeFolder
	* Bugfixing of several trac tickets (like #39)

2007-04-18  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.c:
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_connect),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_disconnect),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_current_iap_id),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_get_iap_list),
	(tny_maemo_conic_device_free_iap_list):
	* libtinymail-maemo/tny-maemo-conic-device.h:
	Take a TnyMaemoConicDevice* instead of a TnyDevice, as that is 
	the convention for derived/implemented objects.
	Correct the TNY_TYPE_MAEMO_CONIC_DEVICE implementation so that 
	this can be used. 

2007-04-17  Shilpa Musti  <Shilpa.Musti@nokia.com>

	* Bugfix in TnyCamelTransportAccount

2007-04-17  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Further implementing of TnyMergeFolder
	* Bugfix in TnyGtkHeaderListModel
	* Updates to the documentation

2007-04-17  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* Fixed a build error regarding the new TnyMaemoConicDevice

2007-04-17  Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* Add the TnyMaemoConicDevice, which exposes libconic-specific
	functionality. When built for scratchbox, it tries to work in 'dummy
	mode', to make it still somewhat functional, even though connectivity
	does not work in scratchbox. The conic-specifics are only lightly
	tested. and need work, esp. for doing something in sbox

	* TnyMaemoDevice goes back to the dummy it was before, so this should
	make pre-libconic compiles (770) also possible; not tested though.

2007-04-13  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Introduction of the TnyMergeFolder type

	* This was a major API change

2007-04-13  Dirk-Jan C. Binnema <dirk-jan.binnema@nokia.com>

	* remove #include for removed tny-maemo-password-dialog.h,
	  this broke the compilation

2007-04-12  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Added skeleton for ACAP support
	* Major modifications to the 'getting of passwords'

	* Support for low, high and normal X-Priority
	* Auto updating the unread count of TnyFolderObservers when unread
	flags are set on a TnyHeader
	* Fixed incrementally filling up a GtkTreeView while downloading is
	taking place (this needs a few small performance improvements btw).	

	* This was a major API change

2007-03-27  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* libtinymail-camel/tny-camel-store-account.c: added a missing folder
	reference when getting folders

2007-03-25  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Support for filling up the header view (a.k.a. the summary view)
	with already or recently downloaded information while downloading is
	taking place. Take a look at the demo user interface's code to learn
	how to leverage this feature: You basically need to register the list
	(which will for example be a TnyGtkHeaderListModel instance) with the
	TnyFolderMonitor before launching the tny_folder_refresh_async method.

	* This ain't an API change, but this new feature does make more
	possible with the same API. It might also change behaviour a little
	bit (although it shouldn't for the old-style of using the 
	TnyFolderMonitor, or at least not as far as I know and tested).

2007-03-23  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Support for X-Priority and X-MSMail-Priority

	Added notification code to tny_camel_folder_copy_folder

2007-03-14  Juerg Billeter <j@bitron.ch>

2007-03-14  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* tny_folder_store_remove now specifies and its implementation will
	unsubscribe all the observers of the folder being removed.

	* This was a major API change

2007-03-09  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Added the tny_account_store_find_account API. It's possible that in
	future a set and get find strategy API will be added. For now, finding
	using only the url-string will suffice (and adding the find strategy
	later wont break the existing API, or at least doesn't have to as far
	as I can see now -- I might laugh at this entry in future, we'll see)
	
	* Changes to the TnyAccountStore implementations, it's more typical 
	now to let the account store store the instances internally, rather 
	than letting it always return new instances. How else are you going 
	to find the original TnyAccount instance with 
	tny_account_store_find_account?

	* Added the tny_account_matches_url_string API, to determine whether a
	specific account instance matches a specific url_string.

	* This was a major API change

2007-03-06  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Bugfixes for summary items and writing them to disk, keeping the
	local array in sync with that is on disk
	* Reimplementation of the TnyGtkHeaderListModel, to use a GPtrArray in
	stead of a GList: should be both faster and less memory consuming

	* tny_account_cancel API

	* This was a major API change

2007-02-20  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Disabled the LIST with LSUB merging (it just doesn't sound right to
	do this, yet Evolution's Camel does this, as a result did camel-lite
	it too. No longer, for now).

2007-02-19  Sergio Villar Senin  <svillar@igalia.com>

	* TnyCamelFolder: Replaced the folder lock by a recursive static
	folder lock

2007-02-12  Philip Van Hoof  <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* This was a major API change

	* This was a major API change

	* Major refactoring in the TnyMimePartSaveStrategy stuff
	* Introduced a new client-type for the strategy pattern:
	the TnyMimePartSaver
	* Removed all saving functionality from the default gtk+
	types: the developer who will create an E-mail client is
	the person who should connect the dots (inherit a TnyMsgView
	and/or a TnyMimePartView, or implement it fully, and let that
	type also implement the TnyMimePartSaver)
	* Renamed TnySaveStrategy to TnyMimePartSaveStrategy

2006-10-13  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Bugfix in tny-camel-folder.c, added documentation aid
	* Fixed possible memory leak

2006-09-25  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Aggressively hardened the TnyCamelFolder implementation. This
	hardening isn't good for debugging, as major bugs and mistakes now
	won't crash. Therefore it's possible that some hardening is going to
	come inbetween #ifdef/#endif's so that developers still get a crashing
	tinymail. However. I soon want to release, therefore this hardening
	tries to on forehand detect problems with the CamelFolder instance.

	These problems specifically arise when CamelOperation cancellations
	have happened. The problem is that the instance (priv->folder) isn't
	always a CamelFolder anymore (especially after cancellation). Sure
	this is a Camel bug or probably a Camel bug, but tinymail crashes
	cause of it. Tinymail's 1.0 release shouldn't crash, period.

	This doesn't mean that I will leave this work-around hack for what it
	is. I will indeed investigate and find the real bug that is causing
	this to happen. Why else do you think I leave a big fat fucking note
	in the ChangeLog for everybody to see?

	Feel free to help me spot it, and/or fix it.

2006-09-19  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed compilation for OLPC, GPE and Maemo platforms

	* Removed silly API in TnySessionCamel, solved the need for the API internally
	* Bug fixes in TnySessionCamel
	* Introduction of TnyGtkFolderTreeModel (however, it's atm unfinished)
	* Introduction of TnyGtkAccountListModel which could be useful for for
	example the GtkComboBox view component, the TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel
	doesn't change in functionality. It's also likely that a
	TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel will also be implemented at some point. The
	TnyGtkAccountListModel in combination with such a
	TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel used on a GtkComboBox and a GtkTreeView would
	mimic the behaviour of the TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel on a GtkTreeView by
	separating the two views (for example a combo box with accounts and a
	treeview with folders in the current account, rather than only support
	for a treeview with both accounts and folders)
	* Added documentation about the Gtk+ tree model column enumerations
	* Added documentation about tinymail enumerations

	* This was a major API change in libtinymail-camel

	* Fixed a reference counting problem on TnyList::copy

	* This was a major API change in libtinymail

2006-09-08  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Fixed the Python bindings
	* Fixed the TnyIterator API (current -> get_current, as it's a
	property like any other property)
	* Added lots of samples to the API reference documentation

	* This was a major API change in all libraries
	
2006-09-06  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Speedup the new get-folders API by caching the CamelFolderStore

2006-08-25  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Lots of files: Removed the tny_folder_iface_uncache API and replaced 
	it with a detection mechanism that automates this. It will now uncache 
	the folder once there's no more header instances of that folder being 
	referenced.

	This indeed means that the reference counting of the headers must be 
	carefully monitored and absolutely correct. Some of the changes of this
	commit included fixes for this. For example the reparenting of the 
	header instance didn't happen in the TnyMsgViewIface implementations in
	ui-gtk and ui-mozembed.

	* This was a major API change in all
