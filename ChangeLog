	* Introduction of the TnyMsgRemoveStrategy, which makes it more
	flexible to define how tinymail should remove messages (as this might

	lot external API has changed. A default remove strategy is used for

	* Major refactoring in the TnyMimePartSaveStrategy stuff
	* Introduced a new client-type for the strategy pattern:
	the TnyMimePartSaver
	* Removed all saving functionality from the default gtk+
	types: the developer who will create an E-mail client is
	the person who should connect the dots (inherit a TnyMsgView
	and/or a TnyMimePartView, or implement it fully, and let that
	type also implement the TnyMimePartSaver)
	* Renamed TnySaveStrategy to TnyMimePartSaveStrategy

	* Fixed possible memory leak

2006-09-25  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Aggressively hardened the TnyCamelFolder implementation. This
	hardening isn't good for debugging, as major bugs and mistakes now
	won't crash. Therefore it's possible that some hardening is going to
	come inbetween #ifdef/#endif's so that developers still get a crashing
	tinymail. However. I soon want to release, therefore this hardening
	tries to on forehand detect problems with the CamelFolder instance.

	These problems specifically arise when CamelOperation cancellations
	have happened. The problem is that the instance (priv->folder) isn't
	always a CamelFolder anymore (especially after cancellation). Sure
	this is a Camel bug or probably a Camel bug, but tinymail crashes
	cause of it. Tinymail's 1.0 release shouldn't crash, period.

	This doesn't mean that I will leave this work-around hack for what it
	is. I will indeed investigate and find the real bug that is causing
	this to happen. Why else do you think I leave a big fat fucking note
	in the ChangeLog for everybody to see?

	Feel free to help me spot it, and/or fix it.

2006-09-19  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Removed silly API in TnySessionCamel, solved the need for the API internally
	* Bug fixes in TnySessionCamel
	* Introduction of TnyGtkFolderTreeModel (however, it's atm unfinished)
	* Introduction of TnyGtkAccountListModel which could be useful for for
	example the GtkComboBox view component, the TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel
	doesn't change in functionality. It's also likely that a
	TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel will also be implemented at some point. The
	TnyGtkAccountListModel in combination with such a
	TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel used on a GtkComboBox and a GtkTreeView would
	mimic the behaviour of the TnyGtkFolderStoreTreeModel on a GtkTreeView by
	separating the two views (for example a combo box with accounts and a
	treeview with folders in the current account, rather than only support
	for a treeview with both accounts and folders)
	* Added documentation about the Gtk+ tree model column enumerations
	* Added documentation about tinymail enumerations

	* This was a major API change in libtinymail-camel

2006-09-08  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* libtinymailui-gtk/tny-account-tree-model.c: Reimplemented using the
	new TnyFolderStoreIface API

2006-08-25  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Speedup the new get-folders API by caching the CamelFolderStore

2006-08-25  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Lots of files: Removed the tny_folder_iface_uncache API and replaced 
	it with a detection mechanism that automates this. It will now uncache 
	the folder once there's no more header instances of that folder being 
	referenced.

	This indeed means that the reference counting of the headers must be 
	carefully monitored and absolutely correct. Some of the changes of this
	commit included fixes for this. For example the reparenting of the 
	header instance didn't happen in the TnyMsgViewIface implementations in
	ui-gtk and ui-mozembed.

	* This was a major API change in all
