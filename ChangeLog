2006-08-25  Philip Van Hoof <pvanhoof@gnome.org>

	* Lots of files: Removed the tny_folder_iface_uncache API and replaced

	the folder once there's no more header instances of that folder being 
	referenced.

	This indeed means that the reference counting of the headers must be 
	carefully monitored and absolutely correct. Some of the changes of this
	commit included fixes for this. For example the reparenting of the 
	header instance didn't happen in the TnyMsgViewIface implementations in
	ui-gtk and ui-mozembed.
