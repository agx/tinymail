<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
An implementation of #TnyMsgHeaderIface that plays proxy for CamelMessageInfo

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
TnyMsgHeader is a proxy for real subject CamelMessageInfo. The type doesn't
use a priv pointer, but in stead is an opaque structure. This is done for 
decreasing the amount of allocations (a priv pointer is an unnecessary 
allocation). Allocations are slow.

A list model (like a tree model) is responsible for calling the uncache
method whenever the corresponding row becomes invisble.

All kinds of dirty non-gobject-standard tricks have been applied to make this
type as fast as possible. Including modifying the TNY_MSG_ACCOUNT() macro and
removing the gobject type-check.

It's possible this type sooner or later gets reimplemented without using
gobject at all. As at this moment, the full size of the GObject type is added
for no real reason.
