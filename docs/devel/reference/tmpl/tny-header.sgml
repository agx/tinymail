<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
TnyHeader

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
A Camel implementation of #TnyHeaderIface

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
A proxy for a #CamelMessageInfo. The type doesn't use a priv pointer, it's 
implemented as a opaque structure. This is done for decreasing the amount 
of allocations (a priv pointer is an unnecessary allocation). Allocations are 
slow.
</para><para>
A list model (like a tree model) is responsible for calling the uncache
method whenever the corresponding row becomes invisble. Most list model 
implementations will do this. This implementation copes with this.
</para><para>
All kinds of dirty non-gobject-standard tricks have been applied to make this
type as fast as possible. Including modifying the TNY_MSG_ACCOUNT() macro and
removing the gobject type-check.
</para><para>
It's possible this type sooner or later gets reimplemented without using
gobject at all. As at this moment, the full size of the GObject type is added
for no real reason.
