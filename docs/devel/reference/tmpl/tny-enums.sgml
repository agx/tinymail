<!-- ##### ENUM TnyHeaderFlags ##### -->
<para>
When defining new flags, please stay below 1&lt;&lt;12. Starting 1&lt;&lt;12 is being used internally (and you would overwrite that,
which can cause severe defects like crashes and memory leaks). You are rather advised not to add any new flags unless
there is really no other way to achieve what you are trying to do (and then still, consider talking to the tinymail
framework developers about simply getting your "special" cool flag added to tinymail itself).
