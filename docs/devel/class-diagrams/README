Below are outdated class diagrams:
-----------------------------------

TnyMsgWindowIface_decorates_TnyMsgViewIface.umbrello.xmi
	Interaction and relations between TnyMsgViewIface and TnyMsgWindow-
	Iface. Illustrates the usage of the decorator pattern. A TnyMsgWind-
	owIface can decorate a TnyMsgViewIface. The TnyMozEmbedMsgView and
	TnyTextBufferMsgView are used as examples.

Overview_Account_Folder_Header_Message_Mimepart.umbrello.xmi
	This is a new updated core-idea/overview class diagram. It does not
	illustrate for example the ui specifics nor the implementation details
	like how most of the objects are a proxy for a camel type.

	So in some way it's a simplified (probably more usable) diagram of the
	first dia diagram.

	It illustrates the interactions between accounts, folders, headers,
	messages, mime parts and streams: the core infrastructure.

Overview_AccountStore_PlatformFactory_Device.umbrello.xmi
	This one illustrates the interactions and relations between the account-
	store, platform factory and device types
