When adding requirements here:

  * Please be brief about the build procedure. Try to refer to building.txt
    for build procedures

  * Try to get as much features as possible documented and working on the
    host. Specifiy when, how and where you can choose (network manager,
    GtkMozEmbed, Python bindings, etc, etc)

  * Don't forget packages that are not pulled by the package management
    automatically (for example of there's no package management on the
    platform)

Ubuntu Edgy, Dapper, etc etc
----------------------------
On a standard Ubuntu Edgy or Dapper all you have to do to get yourself a more
or less interesting tinymail (interesting in terms of enabled components) is
the following apt-get:

apt-get install gnome-devel firefox-dev libnm-glib-dev subversion \
	automake1.9 autoconf2.13 autotools-dev gnome-common

mkdir -p $HOME/repos/tinymail/
cd $HOME/repos/tinymail/
svn co https://svn.tinymail.org/svn/tinymail
cd tinymail/trunk
./autogen.sh --prefix=/opt/tinymail
make
make install

If you also want to build the Python bindings, install python-gtk2-dev python-dev
add --enable-python-bindings to the autogen.sh line.

Redhat, Fedora, etc etc

TODO
